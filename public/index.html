			<h2>Portable password security made easy.</h2>
			<p>Everyone relies on passwords these days - but it's far too easy to break them.  If you store them in an online system, that system can itself be hacked to gain your passwords; meanwhile, local storage systems can be easily stolen or physically broken into.</p>
			<h2>Enter Meema.</h2>
			<p>If one system isn't secure, why not use two?  It's <em>local password storage</em> and <em>cloud password storage</em> working together.  <em><b>And it's about time.</b></em></p>
			<div class="flex-group">
				<div class="flex-column">
					<div class="feature-icon fa fa-cloud"></div>
					<p><b>The cloud storage</b> stores a piece of your password, but not enough to reproduce the whole thing.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-column">
					<div class="feature-icon fa fa-hdd-o"></div>
					<p><b>The local storage</b> also stores some of your password, but still not enough to get the whole thing.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Only with access to both systems can you - <em>and only you</em> - get access to your passwords.<br /><b><em>That's the power of Meema.</em></b></p>
